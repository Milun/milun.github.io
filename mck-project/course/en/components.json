Now, if you’ve used that same password for your work email or company accounts, they're in. Suddenly, they have legitimate access, and it’s like giving them the keys to the kingdom.</p><p>With access to a legitimate company email, they can move around unnoticed, sending emails that look completely legit to other employees. They might trick people into giving up more sensitive information or even authorize transactions. The hacker can dig through emails, documents, and other internal systems, stealing sensitive info, messing with company data, and potentially causing huge financial damage.</p><p>Password reuse isn't just a personal problem; it’s a gateway for hackers to infiltrate the entire company. Think about the client data, confidential projects, and internal communications that could be exposed. Not to mention, it can seriously damage the company’s reputation and lead to legal troubles.</p><p>So, in today’s workshop, we’re going to dive into strong password strategies. We'll cover how to create them, check if your current passwords are strong, and the best ways to save them safely as well as some reasonable strategies for keeping them up to date.

The benefit of a passphrase is that typically they’re easier to remember, but more difficult to crack due to their length.

These tools generate complex, randomised passwords that are difficult for attackers to guess or crack using automated methods. By incorporating a combination of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters in a truly unique way, random password generators ensure a high level of security while minimising the risk of password-related vulnerabilities. Additionally, utilising a password generator eliminates the need for individuals to come up with their own passwords, reducing the likelihood of using weak or predictable combinations. Overall, leveraging a random password generator simplifies the process of password creation while significantly enhancing cybersecurity over other managers, but you are still left to update and store them somewhere - it is unlikely you can remember a number of truly random passwords - leading to the risk of reuse across accounts."},{"title":"Using a password manager","body":"Using a password manager to create and store passwords offers a convenient and secure solution for managing online accounts.

If you ever share passwords - do not use this technique, OR use a separate double blind add-on. Be realistic about what you’re actually going to do - if you share a streaming site with your friends, we’re not going to tell anyone, but we will tell you - don’t be silly!</p> <p>The technique is simple. Create a base password (preferably a truly random one). This password should be unique to this account and not shared anywhere. Feel free to store it using any method you choose (writing it in a book, storing it on a USB, using a password manager, etc.). Then, come up with your own memorable double-blind add-on. Whenever you enter a password, type or fill in your base password first. Then manually type in the double-blind add-on at the end of your base password. You only need to remember one double blind add-on, you can use this same code to all your passwords.</p> <p>For example, if the password manager gives you \"<code>A1b2C3d4</code>\" and you create a double-blind add-on of \"<code>817@263</code>\", your full password will be \"<code>A1b2C3d4817@263</code>\". This way, even if someone gets access to your password manager, they won’t know your add-on, and if they know your add-on, they won’t have the random part.</p><p>Since it’s never written down or shared, it enhances the security of the passwords you do store, and if it’s leaked, it’s harder for hackers to use it.

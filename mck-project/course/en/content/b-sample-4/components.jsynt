        "body": <<<"
			<p>Every risk can be plotted on a graph, but they depend on personal and organisational factors. Here are some examples of the risks people frequently take, how likely they are to occur, and the scale of the damage (also known as 'impact') they can have. Risks that are more likely, or can result in more damage/higher impact are the most critical to address.</p> 

			<p>As your review these general risks, ask yourself whether you do any of these activities, and what your own personal context means - some of these risks might be more damaging to you personally, given your level of access to various systems, how interconnected they are (say by ... a shared or leaked password) or the sensitivity or value of the data exposed by these risks.</p>
